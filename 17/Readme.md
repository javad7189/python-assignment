# Calculator 
In these projects we will make a calculator with pyside6 and qt designer.

I use Qt designer to design face of calculator.
and I use PySide6 to define the functionality of calculator.

My calculator face is like windows calculator because i use pictures for bottuns that they are similar to window calculator bottuns.

The bottuns in the calculator is numbers and +,-,*,/,log,sqrt,sin,cos,tan,cot,negative operation.

furthurmore there is a ce bottun for clear monitor of calculator.

maximum number character that you can enter in the monitor of calculator with bottuns of calculator is 32.

I also use resource.qrc file to define pictures in python program. we must first convert .qrc file to .py file with below command in terminal:
pyside6-rcc resources.qrc -o resources.py 

## How to install
Run following command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run
execute this command in terminal:
python mycalculator.py


## Results

The face of calculator is shown below:
