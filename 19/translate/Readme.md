# Translator software
In these project I made a software with Qt designer and pyside6 library to translate your text.

Qt designer used to create User Interface part.
Pyside6 library used to write the functionality of the software.

Software features:

first:
you have 6 chioces for both source and target language.
these choices are:
'Hindi','English','French','German','Spanish','Persian'

when you open the software the source language is set to English by default and the target language is set to Persian by default.

second:
You should put your text that you want to translate in the left text box. then you must click on the translate bottun. after that the software will be trying to connect to internet to find the translation of youe text.
when it success, the translated text is shown in the right text box
