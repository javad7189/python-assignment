# Line Break Removal Software
In these projects I made a software with Qt designer and pyside6 library to remove all 
line breaker in the text.

Qt designer used to create User Interface part.
Pyside6 library used to write the functionality of the software.

Software features:

first:
you must choose a radio bottun to select which function you want to run.

second:
In the upper text box you can enter your text. then you can click on remove Line Breaks bottun.
after that the software remove the line breaker in the text by itself automatically.

third:
After software finished its job, the edited text is shown in the lower text box and you can copy final text by 
clicking on the copy to clipboard bottun.

pip install -r requirements.txt
