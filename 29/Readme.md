# calculation on images with numpy 
In these projects we use numpy library to do different mathematical calculations on numpy arrays. numpy arrays are our images, so that we can 
use numpy library to make filter on image or add some pictures to each other or subtract two images or multiply images. Each of these have different
usage in image processing and the goal in these projects is that we finally find out how to use this library in our projects.


## How to install
Run following command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run
execute this command in terminal:
python file_name.py
example python question2.py

## Results

first question has two part.
in the first part we mix two picture to reach from one picture to other.
output:

![mix_picture](https://github.com/javad7189/python-assignment/assets/86910174/61f4492e-bc17-483d-8df7-d153796cc9d9)

In second part I use an animal face to put it on my face in a picture of mine. I choose a monkey face for this part but you can use 
another animal faces.lets see output:

2.In the second question we are given 20 pictures of a hole space and we should mix same pictures and then concatenate four part of
hole space to creat a complete noiseless hole space !

output:

![holespace](https://github.com/javad7189/python-assignment/assets/86910174/757abe3c-2aeb-4c4b-aa86-5d60e6d6ec78)

3. In third question i convert a picture of mine to a sketch. 

output:

4.In the fourth question we have to picture that some letters are written on them. we subtract these two pictures to find a new sentence.

output:

5. In the fifth question we have a video of a road that has traffic. Our purpose is to extract the background image.

output:

![road_without_car](https://github.com/javad7189/python-assignment/assets/86910174/5e4aeaab-7516-461f-93c5-2da35de0b2ca)

6. In sixth and last question we use masking to decorate a room.

output:
