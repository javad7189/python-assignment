# Calculator V2 
In these projects we will write a new version for calculator with pyside6 and qt designer.

I use Qt designer to design face of calculator.
and I use PySide6 to define the functionality of calculator.

This time my calculator face has red color.

The bottuns in the calculator is numbers and +,-,*,/,log,sqrt,sin,cos,tan,cot,negative operation.

furthurmore there is a ce bottun for clear monitor of calculator.

maximum number character that you can enter in the monitor of calculator with bottuns of calculator is 32.

In this version the calculator is responsive. this means that if you change it size,the size of all content of calculator include bottuns and its monitor will change. 

Furthurmore I use partial from functool library in this version. By using that I can send a function with input to another function that I call it anytime that I want.

## How to install

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run

python mycalculator.py
