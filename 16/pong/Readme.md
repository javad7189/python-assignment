This game is a competitive game

In this game you can play with system. infact you are on left side of the game and the system is on the right side of the game.
when the game is started, a ball in the center of the game is started to move to a random direction and you and the system must prevent the ball to pass trough yours.

each player has a rocket to contol the ball.
