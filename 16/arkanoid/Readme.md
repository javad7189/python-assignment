# Arkanoid !
In these projects we will made arkanoid game.

features that I put i arkanoid game:
this game has five level.
In first level there are four rows of bricks that player must destroy them.
In each level one row is added to rows, so in last level there are eight rows. the speed of ball increase in each level.
there is a ball in the game that player must control it by move rocket to left and right.
player can move rcket with mouse or left key and right key on keyboard.

if player can't control ball and ball pass the rocket of player, then player lose one of its rocket. In the game player has three rocket and when the player lose all of the rockets, The game overs.

Scores: when each brick is destroyed, the player get one score. but be careful because if the game over, all scores will be lost. player scores will be shown on the top-left corner of the window game, when the player is playing.

When the ball hit the rocket or brick, different sound is played.

When all levels is finished successfully, a congragulation massege is shown to player. :)
