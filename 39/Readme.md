# Machine learning 3

In this section we solve some proble that related to three database about (Online retail),(Covid19),(Digikal)

# First problem:

At first we analyze online retail database. We obtained changes in the amount of income based on months. Then we found out there is a 
large decrease in income in April. I analyze diferent aspect of data  to know the reason of this point.

# Second problem:

In second problem I read covid19 database for all countries. I earn 8 countries with maximum death and then I
draw death rate for Iran in all days in years along with covid19.

# third problem:

In third problem I work on digikala store database. I draw order per month in all database.

Then i draw a pie chart for number of customers per city.
I use two library which names are arabic-reshaper and python-bidi. these libraries able us to write in persian on pie chart.

Lets see different analyze on data to earn more information.

count of customers in all months. we can see in april the customer count is normal.

Order quantity in all months. we can see in april the Order quantit is normal.

Average order price in all months. we can see in april the Average order price is normal.

Revenue base on existing and new customers in all months. we can see in april revenue of existing and new customers has a little decrease.

Ratio of New to Existing Customerin all months. we can see the Ratio of New to Existing Customer in april is normal.

Monthly retention in all months.we can see the monthly retention is April is not bad.

below table shows the loyalty of customers in rest months of the year that they buy something.

we found out from top tables and diagram in April the store couldnt attract enough new customer. beside this old customers or existing customers didnt buy 
enough item in April. So if the store want the April experience wont repeate, the owner must apply a new policy to get new customers or make the old customers buy
more things.

eight countries with most death:
