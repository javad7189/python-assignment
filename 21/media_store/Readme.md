# Database
In these part I work with SQLite again but in a bigger project:

If you followed my repositoy you can find a media store project in 12.
this project wrote by using .txt file as databse. Now I want to rewrite it by sqlite as it database.

these four command are related to sql language and used to work with different database.

I use below sql command to handle the database:

with INSER we can add a new data to a table in database.
with DELETE we can remove an item from a table in database.
with UPDATE we can edite an item from a table in database.
with SELECT we can show an item or more from a table in database.

I creat a database with sqlite software at first that name is media_database.db

I porposed you to use sqlite as database instead of .txt file in your projects. because handling data will be more easily.

You can install sqlite viewer extension in you VScode to see your database in  your VScode.

## How to install

Run following command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run
execute this command in terminal:
python main.py


## Results

the result of python codes are on terminals.
