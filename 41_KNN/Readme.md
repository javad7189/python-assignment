In this section we solve a classification problem to classify some data of fruits.

The algorithm that we use is KNN.
I use this algorithm for three classes which include apple and banana and watermelon.

The Knn algorithm has a parameter which name is K.
I set K to 5.

KNN is an algorithm that use for classifying two class but I use this for 3 class.
Each time I divide the data into two group and try to define the class of data.


The data that we use is width and lenght of three fruits. I train the KNN algorithm with lenght and width of 100 of apples and bananas
and watermelons.

## How to install
Run following command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run

In each .ipynb file run each block to see the result. 

## Results
