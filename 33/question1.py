###   Hi dear

## why do you come here?!!

# because it is impossible to reconstruct an image from its histogram diagram,
# since you can find a lot of picture that their histogram diagrams are alike.

# On the other hand, you cannot get any information about dimension of picture or
# the value brightness of each pixel of image
# from its histogram diagram.
