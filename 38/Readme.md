# Machine learning 2

This section make us to get more knowledge about some useful library in machine learning that names are matplotlib.pyplot and pandas and numpy.

with pandas library we can read and create csv file and work with dataframes.

with matplotlib we can visualize our data in different plot.

with numpy we can work with array and large size of data.

In this assignment, at first I solved all problem in Python for Data Science part in sololearn site and get its certificate.

In the second problem we solve a prboblem about apple and banana and draw different plot for them and calculate some features for them. and finally I try to classify them to two group by their lenght/width ratio feature. 

In third question I create two dataframe for ballones and melones and draw a 3D diagram for them by using matplotlib library.

In fourth problem I worked on california_cities data to draw a scatter plot of its population cities in latitude and longitude diagram.


## How to install
Run following command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run

Run each file in jupyter notebook
