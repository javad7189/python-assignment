# Database
In these part I work with SQLite to use four below command:

INSERT
DELETE
UPDATE
SELECT

these four command are related to sql language and used to work with different database.

with INSER we can add a new data to a table in database.
with DELETE we can remove an item from a table in database.
with UPDATE we can edite an item from a table in database.
with SELECT we can show an item or more from a table in database.

there are four .sql file in sql folder that you can see how these commands work.

python:

In this part I solve three python problem:

first:
In Symmetry_text.py I write a code to check an array and see if it is symmetry or not.

second:
In married.py I write a code to chose random items from two array and put them beside each other in a new list.
lenght of new list is equal to the lenght of an array that has smaller lenght.

third:
In palam_pulum_pilish I write a code for a game.
In this game you must choose 1 or 2 in each round. you play with two computer players.
you must play 5 round and if you can get more score at the end, you win.

when you choose a number that other two players dont, then you get one score.
for example if you choose 1 and other two players choose 2 then you get one score at that round.
