# Convolution
In these projects we use convolution technique to put some filter on images.
Some applications of this technique are:
noise reduction
edge detection(diagonal,horizental,vertical)


## How to install
Run following command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run
execute this command in terminal:
python file_name.py
example python question2.py

## Results

in the first problem we draw a histogram of pixels that belong to an image.
histogram is a diagram that draw count of somthing along index or name of that thing.

output:

In the second problem we blurred the background of a picture which include a flower. The flower is on the foreground and Ù‡t remains unchanged.

output:

In the third question we did edge detection operation on to image. one image is a lion and the other one is a spider. we use laplacian operator for this question.

output:

![lion](https://github.com/javad7189/python-assignment/assets/86910174/881cea92-a7ab-4079-b84c-7cfa61bd18af)

4.In the fourth problem we face a picture of a home and we want to do edge detection on it. but this time different thing happened. we have two result so that one of them is horizental edge detection and the other one is vertical edge detection.

output:

5.In the fifth question we load three image at first and then we apply a filter on it. first time we use a kernel that its dimension is 5*5 and second time its dimension is 15 * 15.

outputs:
