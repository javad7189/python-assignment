# Machine Learning

Finally, we start machine learning.

At this time i can say that the machine learning is a collection a techniques that used for identify different thing by computer.
we use a dataset as input in most of the machine learning algorithm, because we should teach computer to know our purpose.

In some problem we know the answer, and we just need to computer know the answer too.
but in other problems we have a database and dont know the answer, and we want computer to predict the answer.

we should first try to learn two subjet in w3school.
one matplotlib courses
second machine learning courses

## How to install
Run following command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run
execute this command in terminal:
python file_name.py
example python question2.py

## Results

in the first problem I get a picture that include a lot of numbers from zero to nine.
and i used a image processing technique to seperate and put them in specific folder.

output:

the output of this problem is ten folder from zero to nine that each of them include 500 image of same number.



In the second problem I try lobe software to classifying face images into two class:
1.  happyface
2.  suprise face

output:
