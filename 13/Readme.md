As you can see in complexloop_box.py, you should use arcade library. 
Drawing 100 rhombus could be done by using a for loop nested inside another for loop. each for loop count from 0 to 10 and in each step, a rhombus is created in plane.
Another point is about creating rhombus. to make this happen use a function which creates triangle, then draw Two triangles whose bases are joined together.
further more you should change the color of rhombus between red and blue. To do this you can use two 'if' that define color.
