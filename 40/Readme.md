# Machine learning 4

In this section We want to take a deeper look at two below datasets:
1. Billionaire in 2021

2. Lionel Messi Goals until 2019

# First problem:

At first we analyze Billionaire dataset. 

first: we calculate the mean and variance of the richet person.

second: we calclate total networth of each country and show it on diagram.

third: we draw the diagram of ten richest person in america by their networth.

fourth: we draw a diagram of ten countries with lowest number of rich person in dataset.
         X axis is related to countery name and y axis is related to amount of networth of people on that country.

# Second problem:

In second problem I analyze Lionel Messi Goals dataset to get some interesting information.

first: I calculate the number of messi goal in each year.

second: I survey the dataset to know did he take most penalties with his left foot or with his right foot?

third: How many of matches that messi has scored in extra time,was end to win?

fourth: what percentage of messi's goals was equal goal?
